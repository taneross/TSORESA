<ol type="1">
	<li>Choose an instructional cycle that demonstrates the following:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Important content clearly connected to the Ohio Academic Content Standards and/or national standards for subject areas that don’t have Ohio Academic Content Standards, and your district curricula</li>
			<li>Academically rigorous expectations for student learning</li>
			<li>Formative and summative assessment of student learning of content across the instructional cycle aligned to the learning expectations</li>
			<li>Opportunities to provide high-quality and useful feedback to students</li>
			<li>Opportunities for students to self assess and set learning goals during the instructional cycle</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Choose three focal students whose achievement you will track throughout the instructional cycle. See Form 2.4 for guidance on selecting students.</li>
	<li>Select two formative assessments (Formative 1 and 2) and one summative assessment from the instructional cycle. These assessments should provide evidence of academically rigorous expectations for student achievement on key instructional outcomes and/or standards in relation to the central focus across the instructional cycle.  Assessments may require written, oral, and/or visual responses, or performances; assessments that are not written may be captured through photographs, audio clips, and video clips.</li>
	<li>Collect student responses from the entire class for all three assessments. If responses are not written responses, be sure to photograph, audiotape, or videotape a sufficient number of student responses that you will have samples to draw on for your analysis. PDF and mp4 file types are accepted.</li>
	<li>Submit student responses for all three assessments for each of the three focal students you’ve selected.  The same three focal students must be used for each assessment – Formative 1, Formative 2 and Summative.</li>
	<li>Submit evidence of your feedback to the three focal students for all three assessments. Evidence of feedback may be submitted as written feedback on the student responses, OR you may capture feedback provided in other ways (e.g., audio or video clips, rubrics).</li>
	<li>Complete Forms 2.1-2.6.</li>

<h3>GLOSSARY</h3>
<p><strong>Academic Rigor: </strong>Appropriately high expectations for students in their use or application of central concepts, skills, higher order thinking and/or problem solving in your discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Criteria: </strong>Performance indicators used to evaluate what students have learned. Assessment criteria describe expected levels of achievement on an assessment and may examine correctness of answers or the accuracy or quality of student responses. Examples include: rubrics, checklists, point systems for indicating different levels of performance, or criteria for measuring full versus partial credit.</p>
<p><strong>Central Focus:</strong> The primary topic(s), concept(s), or essential question(s) that represent the ultimate learning target for the instructional cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Formative Assessment:</strong>  A formal or informal assessment used to evaluate students' understanding and skills in relation to instructional outcomes, including oral or visual presentations, group activities, performances, quizzes, anecdotal records based on systematic observations of student behavior, running records and written tasks during instruction and homework assignments. Results are used to inform instruction or to make modifications and adjustments during the instructional cycle.
Higher order thinking: Thinking skills that go beyond recalling facts or correct answers and involve some cognitive complexity, for example, analysis, interpretation, compare/contrast, categorization, evaluation, synthesis, drawing evidence-based conclusions, generating rules, questions, or ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Language Needs: </strong>Refers to the needs of students who are English Language Learners and native English speakers with different levels of language proficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong> A formal assessment that is implemented at the end of an instructional cycle to measure student learning and performance against instructional outcomes and to plan future instruction.</p>

	For teachers whose students are able to complete a student perception survey:</p>
<ol type='1'>
    <li>Select one class that you teach or one group of at least 5 students to whom you provide support services to be surveyed. If you are in a co-teaching arrangement, this class should be one in which you play a leading role or teach equally as often as your co-teacher. If you are selecting a class, note that it is preferable that it have a minimum of 15 students enrolled in it, and can enroll no fewer than 5 students for valid survey results.</li>
    <li>Identify the class period and anticipated number of students who will complete the survey.   This must be completed by December 1, 2013.</li>
    <li>Coordinate with your program mentor to find a time to administer the survey between January 13 and February 14.</li>
    <li>If you teach grades K–2, you will receive an individually shipped class pack with hard copy surveys, the administration protocol, script, and a prepaid return envelope—all of which can be tracked—between January 6 and January 10. K–2 students will complete the survey using pen and paper. Once completed, all survey materials, used and unused, and including the class coversheets, must be shipped back to the scanning facility for processing.</li>
    <li>If you teach grades 3–12, you will receive an email with PDFs attached that will include the administration protocol, script, and unique logins for each student between January 6 and January 10. Teachers should reserve a technology lab or laptops for the day on which they wish to administer the surveys during the designated window. Teachers will print and distribute login information to students when ready, and students will use their unique login details to complete the survey online.</li>
    <li>You will receive your survey results for either paper-based or online surveys by April 14. (Individual survey results will not be reported to the State.) Review your results and reflect on the responses by completing the Reflection on Practice and Feedback Form (Form 5.2), which asks questions about what you learned from the feedback and how you may use the feedback to inform your practice.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Note: If you teach pre-K, your students are considered not able to complete a student perception survey; follow the directions below for information about how to complete this task.</i></p>
<p>For teachers whose students are not able to complete a student perception survey based on the criteria above:
<ol type='1'>
	<li>Select a colleague (this can be, but is not required to be, your facilitator) to observe you while you teach one of your classes.</li>
    <li>Have your colleague complete the Observation Response Form. This form includes questions that are aligned to the questions that students will answer on the student survey. The observer should return this form to you when it is complete. You are not required to submit this form.</li>
    <li>Review the feedback you received on the Observation Response Form and complete Form 5.2.</li>
</ol>
